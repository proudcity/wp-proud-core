/**
 * Attach all registered behaviors to a page element.
 *
 * Behaviors are event-triggered actions that attach to page elements, enhancing
 * default non-JavaScript UIs. Behaviors are registered in the Proud.behaviors
 * object using the method 'attach' and optionally also 'detach' as follows:
 * @code
 *    Proud.behaviors.behaviorName = {
 *      attach: function (context, settings) {
 *        ...
 *      },
 *      detach: function (context, settings, trigger) {
 *        ...
 *      }
 *    };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Proud.attachBehaviors is added below to the jQuery ready event and so
 * runs on initial page load. Developers implementing AHAH/Ajax in their
 * solutions should also call this function after new page content has been
 * loaded, feeding in an element to be processed, in order to attach all
 * behaviors to the new content.
 *
 * Behaviors should use
 * @code
 *   $(selector).once('behavior-name', function () {
 *     ...
 *   });
 * @endcode
 * to ensure the behavior is attached only once to a given element. (Doing so
 * enables the reprocessing of given elements, which may be needed on occasion
 * despite the ability to limit behavior attachment to a particular element.)
 *
 * @param context
 *   An element to attach behaviors to. If none is given, the document element
 *   is used.
 * @param settings
 *   An object containing settings for the current context. If none given, the
 *   global Proud.settings object is used.
 * @param reRunAjax
 *   Bool for if we're in ajax-load mode or not
 */

/**
 * Detach registered behaviors from a page element.
 *
 * Developers implementing AHAH/Ajax in their solutions should call this
 * function before page content is about to be removed, feeding in an element
 * to be processed, in order to allow special behaviors to detach from the
 * content.
 *
 * Such implementations should look for the class name that was added in their
 * corresponding Proud.behaviors.behaviorName.attach implementation, i.e.
 * behaviorName-processed, to ensure the behavior is detached only from
 * previously processed elements.
 *
 * @param context
 *   An element to detach behaviors from. If none is given, the document element
 *   is used.
 * @param settings
 *   An object containing settings for the current context. If none given, the
 *   global Proud.settings object is used.
 * @param trigger
 *   A string containing what's causing the behaviors to be detached. The
 *   possible triggers are:
 *   - unload: (default) The context element is being removed from the DOM.
 *   - move: The element is about to be moved within the DOM (for example,
 *     during a tabledrag row swap). After the move is completed,
 *     Proud.attachBehaviors() is called, so that the behavior can undo
 *     whatever it did in response to the move. Many behaviors won't need to
 *     do anything simply in response to the element being moved, but because
 *     IFRAME elements reload their "src" when being moved within the DOM,
 *     behaviors bound to IFRAME elements (like WYSIWYG editors) may need to
 *     take some action.
 *   - serialize: When an Ajax form is submitted, this is called with the
 *     form as the context. This provides every behavior within the form an
 *     opportunity to ensure that the field elements have correct content
 *     in them before the form is serialized. The canonical use-case is so
 *     that WYSIWYG editors can update the hidden textarea to which they are
 *     bound.
